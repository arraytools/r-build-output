The last error is from texi2dvi which is related to (not avail) pdflatex. Don't need to worry about it.

So the R-3.2.2\bin\ contains R.exe, Rscript.exe and i386 subfolder contains more executables.

Question: how to diable creating NEWS.pdf which gave an error pdflatex is not available?
In fact, NEWS.pdf has existed under R-3.2.2\doc from R source tarball though the github does not show this file.

If we care about pdflatex, install MikTex. Then 
PATH=%PATH%;C:\Program Files\MikTex 2.9\miktex\bin\x64
It still gave an error and was asked to check
C:/Users/brb/AppData/Local/MikTex/2.9/miktex/log/pdflatex.log

N.B. I could not install MiKTex successfully. The error message is discussed on http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/146885/miktex-install-fails. 
Trying to install onto different directory does not help:( An alternative approach is to download the portable version and install it onto e.g. C:\Users\brb\Downloads\miktex\ directory.
Before the first time to run this portable miktex, we need to run 'miktex-portable.cmd' program. This will create a notification icon in the task bar.
Right click on it, start Miktex Options and choose Yes for the option 'install missing packages on-the-fly'.

So far, the only error we have is about 'texi2any'. This is relate to creating the manuals.
