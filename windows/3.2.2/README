# Got errors complaining about loadNamespace(Rcpp) when building package 'methods'.
# However 32-bit R.exe is still created (even tcl, Rcpp not taken care)

# Use the generated R.exe to run install.packages("Rcpp")
# But be sure the package is installed to the current R/library
#     not Documents/R/R-3.2 folder.
# install.packages("Rcpp", lib="C:/users/brb/Downloads/R-3.2.2/library",

We can run 'make' command again if there is any errors. 

The last error is from texi2dvi which is related to (not avail) pdflatex.

So the R-3.2.2\bin\ contains R.exe, Rscript.exe and i386 subfolder.

Question: how to diable creating NEWS.pdf which gave an error pdflatex is not available?
In fact, NEWS.pdf has existed under R-3.2.2\doc from R source tarball though the github does not show this file.

If we care about pdflatex, install MikTex. Then 
PATH=%PATH%;C:\Program Files\MikTex 2.9\miktex\bin\x64
It still gave an error and was asked to check
C:/Users/brb/AppData/Local/MikTex/2.9/miktex/log/pdflatex.log
