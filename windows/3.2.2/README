# Got an error complaining about loadNamespace(Rcpp). 
# However R.exe is still created.
# Use the generated R.exe to run install.packages("Rcpp")
# But be sure the package is installed to the current R/library
#     not Documents/R/R-3.2 folder.
# install.packages("Rcpp", lib="C:/users/brb/Downloads/R-3.2.2/library",

We can run 'make' command again if there is any errors. 

The last error is from texi2dvi which is related to (not avail) pdflatex.

So the R-3.2.2\bin\ contains R.exe, Rscript.exe and i386 subfolder.

Question: how to diable creating NEWS.pdf which gave an error pdflatex is not available?
In fact, NEWS.pdf has existed under R-3.2.2\doc from R source tarball though the github does not show this file.
